In experimenting with Ryan, we found
- if you run hashpipe from a python script,
    it exits when the script exist (we don't know why)
    If you run a shell script from a python script,
    and the shell script runs hashpipe,
    then both shell script and hashpipe continue to run
    after python script exist.
    That's good.
    But killing the shell script doesn't kill hashpipe.
    However, killing hashpipe causes the shell script to exit

So we came up with the following scheme

starting hashpipe
    start.py (on head node)
        for each DAQ node
            copy to node:
                run_hashpipe.sh
                module.config
                config files
                start_daq.py
            ssh to run start_daq.py

    start_daq.py (on DAQ node)
        args: run name, file size, module IDs
        create run_hashpipe.sh
            hashpipe command line, including
                SAVELOC: path to run dir
                MAXFILESIZE: from data config
                redirects stderr/stdout
        create module.config
            list of module IDs
        run run_hashpipe.sh (in new session, detach)
        use pgrep to find PID of the hashpipe process
        write that to a daq_pid

    run_hashpipe.sh
        runs hashpipe, passing cmdline args

    hashpipe
        reads module.config
------------
1/26/22:
did:
    start hashpipe remote with start/stop scripts
        python on head node / python on DAQ/ shell script / hashpip
    tell it what quabos to expect data from:
        notion of "module ID": bits 2..10 of base IP addr
    hashpipe doesn't:
        create run dir
        record HK data
todo, short-term:
    some hashpipe changes
    finish start.py
    actually record data
    redirect hashpipe stdout/stderr to log files, collect these

longer term
    calibration
    hashpipe:
        orient 32x32 images

Definition of "run in progress":
A run is in progress if there's a file "run_name"
    in the data dir on the head node.
start.py creates this before it starts anything.
    it complains if it already exists
stop.py:
    if there's a run in progess, terminate it normally,
        e.g. collect its data
        and deletes "run_name".

A run involves "recording activities" on distributed nodes,
There are two kinds of "recording activities":
1) recording HK data (store_redis_data.py on the head node)
2) a hashpipe process

Normally, start.py starts these activities,
and stop.py stops them.
So there always at most one instance of the activity -
e.g. at most one hashpipe process on a host.

But it's possible a recording activity could be active
even after stop.py has been called,
perhaps because stop.py failed for some reason partway through

It would be bad if more than one instance of a recording activity
was active at the same time -
for example, you wouldn't want two hashpipe processes running at once.
So we want to prevent this from happening.

Here's how we do it:
start.py:
    fail if some recording activity was already active
    (possibly leave some recording activities active)
    in particular:
        local: fail if HK record running
        start_daq.py: fail if an instance of hashpipe already running
    tell user:
        you or another 

stop.py: (in addition to the above)
    if there is no run in progress:
        kill HK recording
        kill all hashpipes on DAQ nodes
            stop_daq.py:
                if no current run,
                kill all hashpipe processes

status.py:
    if no run in progress:
        show status of recording activities
            (use status_daq.py for remote nodes)

So for the end user:

- if your start.py fails because something already active,
    just do stop.py and try again.

- if you want to make sure your start.py won't fail for this reason,
    do "status.py".  If it shows something active, do stop.py
    (or just do stop.py)

How to deal with multiple preople using a single observatory?
Users could issue start/stop commands from different head nodes
(e.g. multiple nodes configured to be a head node)

for starters:
start/stop commands: make sure they're being run on the head node
specified in obs_config.json

If someone is doing a run,
other start.py commands will fail because of the above.
Tell the user: it's possible that someone else is
using the observatory.
If this is possible, please check for this before doing stop.py

Note: it a user runs stop.py, it stop recording any other user's run

--- also ---

we do start/stop stuff remotely by using ssh to run *_daq.py.
But what if head node = DAQ node, i.e. one node?
We could avoid ssh'ing to the same node;
Instead package code in *_daq.py and call it from script

Maybe better to always use SSH - uniformity.

So various possibilities:

1) single node - both head and DAQ
2) multiple nodes; head node is also DAQ node
3) multiple nodes: head node is not a DAQ node

daq_config.json specifies:
    - IP and data dir for head node
    - IP, username and data dir for each DAQ node

start.py: check that we're running on head node

--- also ---

On head node:
    command dir: where you run start/stop/status commands from.
        typically source dir, but could be elsewhere.
        config files must be here
        No files are created here.
    data dir
        All files are created here
        run dirs
        current run name

on DAQ nodes
    data dir
        run dirs
        if remote:
            *_daq.py source code is copied here
            keep track of current run in "current_run_daq".

Add command to show silver version (after reboot)
